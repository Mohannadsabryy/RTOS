Question:
This introductory lab demonstrates the idea of multitasking with FreeRTOS, The setup involves two tasks, 
vPeriodicTask1 and vPeriodicTask2, both having equal priority. FreeRTOS smoothly switches between 
these tasks, enabling each to print its message "Task x is running\r\n" through UART in a loop every 1 
second.
