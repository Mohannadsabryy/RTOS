Question:
It is required to implement a FreeRTOS app which consists of two tasks, vPeriodicGreenLedTask and 
vPeriodicRedLedTask, which are implemented with equal priority. The scheduler efficiently alternates 
between these tasks, resulting in a constant cycle where each task blinks an LED for one second. The 
vPeriodicGreenLedTask toggles the green LED, while the vPeriodicRedLedTask toggles the red LED.
