Lab4: Passing parameters to tasks (2nd serial example) 
In this lab, Itâ€™s required to implement 2 tasks ("Task 1" and "Task 2") of the same priority sharing the 
same task body (function) but for varied behavior, each task shall print its message like "Task 1 is 
running\r\n" and "Task 2 is running\r\n" sent over UART every second.
