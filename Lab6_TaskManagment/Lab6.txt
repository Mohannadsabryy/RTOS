Lab6: FreeRTOS Delay & Idle Task 
This lab is to explain the concept of using vTaskDelay as an alternative to traditional blocking delays. This 
example serves as an introduction to the efficient management of task delays within FreeRTOS. 
Additionally, the lab illustrates the idea of the idle task in the overall system. Tasks, represented by " 
vPeriodicGreenLedTask" and " vPeriodicRedLedTask," utilize vTaskDelay to achieve dynamic LED toggling 
between green and red LEDs using non-blocking delays of 1sec.
